        <h1>Pico De Gallo</h1>
        <img src="../images/pico.jpg">
        <p>A classic Mexican tomato dip (or sauce) that adds a fresh, healthy, 
            low-calorie boost of flavor to just about any Mexican meal.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup finely chopped white onion (about 1 small onion)</li>
            <li>1 medium jalapeño or serrano pepper, ribs and seeds removed, 
                finely chopped (decrease or omit if sensitive to spice, or add another if you love heat)</li>
            <li>¼ cup lime juice</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon fine sea salt, more to taste</li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds ripe red tomatoes (about 8 small or 4 large), chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup finely chopped fresh cilantro (about 1 bunch)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium serving bowl, combine the chopped onion, jalapeño, 
                lime juice and salt. Let it marinate for about 5 minutes while you chop the tomatoes and cilantro.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cilantro to the bowl and stir to combine. 
                Taste, and add more salt if the flavors don’t quite sing.</li>
            <li>For the best flavor, let the mixture marinate for 15 minutes or several hours in the refrigerator. 
                Serve as a dip, or with a slotted spoon or large serving fork to avoid transferring 
                too much watery tomato juice with your pico. 
                Pico de gallo keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 4 days.</li>
        </ol>
