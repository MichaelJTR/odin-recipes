            <li>2 cinnamon sticks</li>
            <li>1 can of 12 oz. of evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 can of 23 oz. can of condensed milk</li>
            <li>8 cups of warm water</li>

            <li>Ground cinnamon to garnish</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of vanilla</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and drain the rice. Place the rice, cinnamon sticks (see note #1 below) and 4 cups of water into a bowl. 
                Cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight (preferably) or a minimum of 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Once you're ready to blend the rice, remove most of the cinnamon sticks but it's okay to leave small pieces with the rice.</li>
            <li>Blend the rice in two separate batches by adding 1/2 of the rice & water with some of the cinnamon stick left behind. 
                Puree until it's very smooth and it forms a paste like texture. About 4 minutes long.</li>
            <li>Using a very fine strainer (or some cheese cloth) pour the blended mixture over a pitcher. 
                Strain out as much liquid as possible, pushing on the solids with a spatula or spoon.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process for the rest of the rice, water & cinnamon mixture.</li>
            <li>Stir in the milks, vanilla (0ptional), and 4 cups of water. Stir well.</li>
            <li>Taste and add more sugar or water if needed.</li>
            <li>Chill and stir before serving over ice. </li>
        </ol>
